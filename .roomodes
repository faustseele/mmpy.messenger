      "customInstructions": "1. **Context Sync**: Before finishing ANY task, you MUST update `04_1_tasks.md` and `03_active_context.md`.\n2. **Conflict Resolver**: If a request violates `01_architecture.md`, you MUST stop and report the conflict. Never bypass the 'Supreme Law'.\n3. **Clarification Gate**: If >1 implementation path exists, stop and present a KISS-score (1-10) for each. Wait for dev input.\n4. **Task Migration**: When all items in `04_1_tasks.md` are marked `[x]`, move them to `04_2_tasks_done.md` with a timestamp and clear the active list.\n5. **Archiving**: If `02_decisions.md` exceeds 20 entries, move old ones to `/ops/context/archive/decisions_YYYY_MM.md`."
